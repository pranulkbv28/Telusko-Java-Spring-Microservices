# $Stacks$ $in$ $Java$

## $What$ $is$ $a$ $Stack$?

- A **Stack** is a linear data structure that follows the **Last In First Out (LIFO)** principle, meaning the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed.
- Stacks are used in various applications such as expression evaluation, backtracking algorithms, and function call management in programming languages.

## $How$ $to$ $Implement$ $a$ $Stack$ $in$ $Java$?

- In Java, a stack can be implemented using arrays or linked lists. The `java.util.Stack` class provides a built-in implementation of a stack.
- The primary operations of a stack include:
  - `push()`: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
  - `pop()`: Removes and returns the top element of the stack.
  - `peek()`: Returns the top element without removing it.
  - `isEmpty()`: Checks if the stack is empty.
  - `size()`: Returns the number of elements in the stack.

## $Implementation$

- [See here](./IntroToStack.java) for a basic creation and implementation of a `Stack` using `Arrays` in Java the same above methods.
