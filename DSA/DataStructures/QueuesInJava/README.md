# $Queues$ $in$ $Java$

## $What$ $is$ $a$ $Queues$?

- A **Queue** is a linear data structure that follows the **First In First Out (FIFO)** principle, meaning the first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed.
- Queues are used in various applications such as task scheduling, breadth-first search algorithms, and resource management.

## $How$ $to$ $Implement$ $a$ $Queue$ $in$ $Java$?

- In Java, a queue can be implemented using arrays or linked lists. The `java.util.Queue` interface provides a built-in implementation of a queue.
- The primary operations of a queue include:
  - `add()`: Adds an element to the end of the queue.
  - `remove()`: Removes and returns the front element of the queue.
  - `peek()`: Returns the front element without removing it.
  - `isEmpty()`: Checks if the queue is empty.
  - `size()`: Returns the number of elements in the queue.

## $Implementation$

- [See here](./IntroToQueue.java) for a basic creation and implementation of a `Queue` using `Arrays` in Java the same above methods.
