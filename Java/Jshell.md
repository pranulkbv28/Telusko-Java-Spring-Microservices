# What is JShell

- `JShell` is a `Read-Evaluate-Print Loop` (REPL), a command-line tool that allows you to execute Java code snippets and get immediate feedback.
- It's an interactive tool for learning `Java` and `prototyping` code.
- You can define variables, classes, and methods and immediately see the output.
- It is very helpful when learning the Java language and for rapid prototyping.

## How to use JShell

1. **Open a terminal or command prompt.**
2. **Type `jshell` and press Enter.** This will start the JShell session.
   You'll see a welcome message and a prompt like `jshell>`.
3. **Start typing Java code snippets!** For example:

```java
System.out.print("Hello World");
```

4. **JShell will execute the code and display the result immediately.**
5. **Experiment with variables, classes, and methods.**
6. **Use `/help` to see a list of available JShell commands.**  
   These allow you to list snippets, view variables, and more.
7. **To exit JShell, type `/exit` and press Enter. Or you can also use `Ctrl+D` for the same.**
