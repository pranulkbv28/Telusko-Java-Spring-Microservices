- It's an interactive tool for learning `Java` and `prototyping` code.
- You can define variables, classes, and methods and immediately see the output.
- It is very helpful when learning the Java language and for rapid prototyping.

1. **Open a terminal or command prompt.**
2. **Type `jshell` and press Enter.** This will start the JShell session.
   You'll see a welcome message and a prompt like `jshell>`.

4. **JShell will execute the code and display the result immediately.**
5. **Experiment with variables, classes, and methods.**
6. **Use `/help` to see a list of available JShell commands.**  
   These allow you to list snippets, view variables, and more.
