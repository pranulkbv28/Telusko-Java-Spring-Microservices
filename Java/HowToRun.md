# How to run a Java file?

1. since all the `Java` files in this project have `pakages` written on top, we need to stay in the parent directory, and in our case it is the `root folder`.
2. from here, run

```bash
javac Java/DataTypes/PrimitiveDataTypes.java
```

3. after this, a `PrimitiveDataTypes.class` file will be generated in the same directory as `PrimitiveDataTypes.java`.
4. this is the compiled binary file of the `PrimitiveDataTypes.java` file.
5. now run

```bash
java Java/DataTypes/PrimitiveDatatypes
```

6. after this, you will be able to see the result.
