# How to run a Java file?

1. Since all the `Java` files in this project have `packages` written on top, we need to stay in the parent directory, which in our case is the `root folder`.
2. From here, run:

    ```bash
    javac Java/DataTypes/PrimitiveDataTypes.java
    ```

3. After this, a `PrimitiveDataTypes.class` file will be generated in the same directory as `PrimitiveDataTypes.java`.
4. This is the compiled binary file of the `PrimitiveDataTypes.java` file.
5. Now run:

    ```bash
    java Java/DataTypes/PrimitiveDataTypes
    ```

6. After this, you will be able to see the result.
