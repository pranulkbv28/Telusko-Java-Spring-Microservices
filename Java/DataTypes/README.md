# $Data$ $Types$

## $What$ $are$ $Data$ $Types?$

- In programming, data types are an important concept that defines the **type of data** that can be **stored** and **manipulated** within a program.
- They determine the kind of values that can be assigned to variables, the operations that can be performed on those values, and how much **memory is allocated** for storing them.

## $Mutation$

- Primitive type variables are `mutable`, meaning their values **can be changed** after they are initialized.
- On the other hand, reference type variables are `immutable`, meaning their values **cannot be changed** after they are initialized. However, the objects they reference can be modified. Even `String` objects, which are reference types, are immutable in Java.
