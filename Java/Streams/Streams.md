## What is Streams?

- In `Java`, a stream is a sequence of elements that can be processed in parallel or sequentially. They were introduced in Java 8 as a way to perform operations on collections of data in a more functional and declarative style.
- Characteristics of `Streams`:
  - **Not a Data Structure**: Streams don't store data themselves. They operate on existing collections or data sources.
  - **Functional in Nature**: Operations on streams are typically chained together to form a pipeline of operations.
  - **Lazy Evaluation**: Streams are lazy, meaning that operations are only performed when the terminal operation is called.
  - **Consumable**: Once a stream has been processed by a terminal operation, it cannot be reused.
  - **Parallelism**: Streams can be easily parallelized to take advantage of multiple cores.

## Why Use Streams?

Streams offer several benefits over traditional collection processing:

- **Declarative Style**: You express what you want to do, rather than how to do it.
- **Concise Code**: Stream operations often result in shorter and more readable code.
- **Efficiency**: Streams can optimize operations and potentially leverage parallel processing.
- **Composability**: Stream operations can be chained together to create complex processing pipelines.
