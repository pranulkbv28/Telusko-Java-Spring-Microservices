## $What$ $is$ $OOPs$

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm, or style of programming, that is built around the concept of **"objects"**.

- Think of objects as real-world entities that have both `data` **(attributes)** and `actions` **(behavior)**. For example:

- Object: A car
  - **Data (attributes)**: _`color`_, _`model`_, _`speed`_
  - **Actions (behavior)**: _`start`_, _`accelerate`_, _`brake`_
